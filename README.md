# README

## Overview

This repository contains R code used to generate the figures and analyses presented in the manuscript titled **"Soil health is associated with higher primary productivity across Europe"**. The code produces all figures, supplementary figures, and performs the statistical analyses described in the manuscript.

## Content

### Figures and Supplementary Figures
The code in this repository generates all the figures and supplementary figures included in the manuscript. Each figure is created using various R packages for data visualization, ensuring high-quality graphical representations of the results.

### Statistical Analyses
The repository includes scripts for all statistical analyses presented in the manuscript, including:

1. **Random Forest Models**: Used to assess the importance of different soil health indicators on primary productivity.
2. **Structural Equation Models (SEM)**: Applied to understand the direct and indirect relationships between soil health, environmental variables, and primary productivity. The code to produce SEMs has been written by Dr. Dongxue Xao [taodx879@nenu.edu.cn].
3. **Linear Regressions**: Performed to establish the associations between soil health metrics and primary productivity.
